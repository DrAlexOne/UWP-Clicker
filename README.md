# UWP-Clicker
My idea about New Clicker



### Target platform - Universal Windows

### Target version - Windows 10 Spring Creators Update (build 17134)

### Minimal version - Windows 10 Creators Update (build 15063)

### Knowing issues:
- Nothing


### Dont developer, but want install and see?
Go to folder UWP Clicker>UWP Clicker>AppPackages>UWP Clicker_0.1.2.0_Test and open file UWP Clicker_0.1.2.0_x86_x64_arm.appxbundle.
If you got problems with installing, try open context menu for file Add-AppDevPackage.ps1 and choose "Run with PowerShell"
